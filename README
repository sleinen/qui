The `qui' program can be used to observe the use (occupancy) of a
system's queues in real time.

The basic idea is this:

The program will run in an endless loop, looking at the state of the
queues of the sockets you are interested at a high frequency,
typically many times per second.  When a queue is seen that exceeds a
(user-specified) threshold, the socket is listed along with the
momentary queue occupancy.

The original version was written in Perl and can be found in `qui.pl'.

A newer version, written in C, is under development.

Both versions use the /proc/net/{udp,udp6,tcp,tcp6} interface to get
queue sizes.  This is only available under Linux, so the tool cannot
work on other systems.
